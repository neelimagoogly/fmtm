## :hugs: Welcome 

:+1::tada: First off, We are really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help improve the Field Mapping Tasking Manager (FMTM)! :tada::+1:

We welcome and encourage contributors of all skill levels, and we are committed to making sure your participation is inclusive, enjoyable, and rewarding. If you have never contributed to an open source project before, we are a good place to start, and we will make sure you are supported every step of the way. If you have **any** questions, please ask!

You can see an overview of the project and the process we have gone through in developing FMTM so far in these [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UrBG1X4MXwVd8Ps498FDlAYvesIailjjPPJfR_B4SUs/edit#slide=id.g15c1f409958_0_0) .

Furthermore, there are many ways to contribute to the **Field Mapping Tasking Manager (FMTM)**, which includes:

## Testing

Right now, we are in the process of building the prototype. We warmly welcome your input in testing and sharing your feedback. If you are also interested in coordinating a field testing session, please reach out!

## Code contributions

Create pull requests (PRs) for changes that you think are needed. We would really appreciate your help!

In fact, we are specifically looking for input from developers with **Python skills** and **familiarity with Fast API**.

## Report bugs and suggest improvements

The [issue queue](https://github.com/hotosm/fmtm/issues) is the best way to get started. There are issue templates for BUGs and FEATURES that you can use, you could also create your own. Once you have submitted an issue, it will be assigned one label from the following [label categories](https://github.com/hotosm/fmtm/labels). If you are wondering where to start, you can filter by the **good first issue label**.
