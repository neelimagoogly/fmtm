# Structures To Improve GitHub Documentation

## Overview

An overall documentation structure outline, that cuts across;
**Project**, **Product**, **System** and **Process
documentation**. These structures can be replicated for all forms of
documentation needed by **HOTOSM**. It also includes specific tips for
improving already existing documentation.

## Goals
1. Highlight the definitions of each type of documentation that are
   commonly used on Github.
2. Provide a foundation to lay information on top of, in order to
   produce efficient documentation about any product or project in the
   future.
3. List key parts of each documentation type that aid the flow and
   experience of the reader.
4. Outline general tips to improve already existing documentation.

## Common Documentation Types On Github

I have found 4 main documentation types through my own personal
research. They can all be written individually but often coincide to
complement specific parts of each other. For example, Product
documentation may include some Process documentation under the Usage
section, demonstrating how to use that product. These 4 types in full,
are as follows:

- **Product Documentation** 
- **Project Documentation**
- **System Documentation**
- **Process Documentation**

### 1. Structure for Product Documentation

Product documentation is the process of recording key information
(almost everything you need to know) about a product,  including how
to use it. Product documentation may have form of **Process
documentation** within it (this will be further explained later on). A
flexible and reusable structure of essential components of product
documentation is as follows:
- Overview
- Introduction: What the product is, what it does, the target audience, etc.
- Features: A breakdown of each integral part of the product, their
  functionality and purpose
- Benefits: How the features give users an edge over other similar
  products. In other words, what’s in it for the user.
- Usage: A step by step process of how to use the product
- Support / Frequently Asked Questions (about the product)
- License

The points stated above can be used in that order and can also be
switched around based on convenience and the type of
product. Additionally, other points can be added if necessary, but
these are what I believe to be some of the most important.

### 2. Structure for Project Documentation

Project documentation is the process of recording the key project
details that are needed to implement a project. It’s like a roadmap of
what the project is and all necessary information about what it
entails. Main structural components are in the following order:
- Overview
- Vision
- Aim / Mission
- Introduction
- Project plan
- Project schedule
- Tools and Features
- Access
- Resources
- Support / Guidelines
 
### 3. Structure for System Documentation

System documentation is an all-encompassing record of details of a
full working system. It is very similar to the structure of product
documentation but it’s usually on a wider scale. It may even include
some forms of product and process documentation within it. In addition
to the structure of product documentation above, other key components
it might include are: **architecture design**, **program source code**
and **maintenance / help guide**.

### 4. Structure for Process Documentation

Process documentation is capturing and listing all steps involved in
doing a task. It is the full explanation of a process, step by
step. Process documentation is very useful in other documentation
forms. As mentioned earlier, it can be used within **System**,
**Product** or **Project** documentation, to explain a process. The
format is usually:
- Overview
- Introduction
- Explanation steps (breakdown of the task)
- Help (if any problems occur while acting on the steps)

The structures I have suggested above are similar, consistent and can
be easily replicated for various projects, systems and products. They
work well when integrated together, balancing out issues where
necessary. Each structure also serves as a foundation that can be
added to and built upon.

## Improving Existing Documentation

1. **Acronyms should be stated in full before repetitive
   use**. Acronyms like ODK, OSM, etc, should be stated in full before
   use or after each use within brackets e.g ODK (Open Data Kit). This
   negates confusion for readers / users and just simplifies things.

2. **Important features should be put in bold**. For example “select
   from map” and ‘’ODK Collect” can be easily overlooked by readers if
   they aren't highlighted, even though they are important features.

3. **Generally simplifying words and phrases**. This makes
   documentation more user friendly and much easier to understand,
   since users come from all different backgrounds. For example:

    “ODK incorporates a new functionality” can become “ODK has brought in a new feature”.

    “Field Mappers select (or are allocated) individual tasks within a
    project’s AOI” could be changed to “Field Mappers choose or are
    given tasks that are part of a project’s Areas Of Interest.”

4. **Avoid long paragraphs**. Short paragraphs that pass a clear
    message are less clumsy and flustering for readers. Breaking down
    topics into little, easy to understand chunks, is more user
    friendly.

5. **Maintain a positive tone in the writing.**. Keep the text
   positive and informative. Avoid words like ‘obviously’ and
   ‘basically’,  that may be interpreted as demeaning or
   condescending. Do not expect readers to have a certain amount of
   knowledge on specific aspects, break down everything that needs to
   be broken down.

6. **Constantly update your documentation**. Projects, products and
   systems are always evolving. Thus, it is necessary to keep
   documentation up to date with any new changes.

7. **Consistency in the documentation format**. Maintaining
   consistency is a key aspect of creating clear and effective
   documentation.This consistency includes but is not limited to
   elements like numbering, font styles, heading sizes, and spacing.

    Using the same font for all headings and subheadings can help
    readers quickly identify important sections of the
    document. Similarly, using consistent spacing between paragraphs
    and sections can make the document more visually appealing and
    easier to follow. This helps to create a documentation that is
    clear, effective, and easy to use.
