### 1. Introduction

A **Mapping Campaign** refers to an organized effort of collecting data from a particular geographic area/feature and creating maps. This may involve using various mapping technologies such as; GPS, satellite imagery, or crowdsourced data. These technologies are used to gather information about the area of interest.

Mapping campaigns can be carried out for lots of different purposes, some examples are:

- Disaster Response and Recovery
- Environmental Conservation
- Urban planning or;
- Social and Political Activism.

They often involve collaboration between organizations like: Government Agencies, Non-profit Groups and volunteers.

Once the data is collected, it is analyzed and processed to create detailed maps that can have a variety of use cases. These could be:

- Identifying areas of need.
- Planning infrastructure and development projects.
- Understanding the impact of environmental changes on the landscape, etc.

### 2. An Overview Of The Field Mapping Tasking Manager (FMTM) In Relations With Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), Open Street Mapping (OSM) and Open Data Kit (ODK).

The **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT**) is a non-profit organization that uses open mapping data to support humanitarian and disaster response efforts around the world. **The Field Mapping Task Manager (FMTM)** is one of the tools that **HOT** used to coordinate and manage mapping projects.

**FMTM** is a software tool that helps project managers to organize and manage mapping tasks. It assigns those tasks to volunteers and tracks their progress. The tool includes features for collaborative editing, data validation, and error detection. This ensures that the data collected by volunteers is accurate and reliable.

**FMTM** is designed to be used in conjunction with **Open Data Kit (ODK)**. **ODK** is a free and open-source set of tools that allows users to create, collect, and manage data with mobile devices. The **ODK** provides a set of open-source tools that allow users to build forms, collect data in the field, and aggregate data on a central server. It is commonly used for data collection in research, monitoring and evaluation, and other development projects.  

Project managers use **FMTM** to manage tasks and assign them to volunteers. The data collected by the volunteer via ODK is typically uploaded to **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**. **OSM** is a free and open-source map of the world that is created and maintained by volunteers.

Overall, the **FMTM** tool is an important component of **HOT**'s efforts to support disaster response and humanitarian efforts around the world. By coordinating mapping activities and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data collected by volunteers, **FMTM** helps to provide critical information that can be used to support decision-making and improve the effectiveness of humanitarian efforts.

### 3. Steps On How To Use The FMTM Tool For A Mapping Campaign.

1. Navigate to the [FMTM website](https://fmtm.hotosm.org/).

2. Click on **EXPLORE PROJECTS** to checkout the projects available for mapping

3. Select a project to map in your location.

4. The drop down icon beside **LEGEND** displays a color code. This color code lets you know the status of each task on the map.
- **READY** means that task is available to be mapped
- **LOCKED FOR MAPPING** means that task is already being mapped by another volunteer and therefore unavailable for mapping
- **MAPPED** or **READY FOR VALIDATION** means that task has been completely mapped and ready to be validated.
- **LOCKED FOR VALIDATION** means that task has been mapped and being validated.
- **VALIDATED** means that task has successfully been validated and completely mapped with no errors
- **INVALIDATED** or **MORE MAPPING NEEDED** means that task did not pass the validation process and needs more mapping
- **BAD** means that task is not clear and cannot be mapped

> Note: 'task' refers to each section of the map enclosed in the dotted lines and each task has a corresponding number tag.

5. To begin mapping, click on a task closest to you that has the color code associated with **READY** and change it's status from **READY** to **LOCKED FOR MAPPING**. Remember to take note of the number tag.

6. Scroll to the bottom of the page. The **ACTIVITIES** tab shows the tasks either **LOCKED FOR MAPPING**, **BAD** or **LOCKED FOR VALIDATION**. You can search for tasks with the status mentioned using the number tag associated with each task.

7. The **MY TASKS** tab shows the tasks available for mapping and the QR code associated with each task. Scroll through and select the number tag of the task you locked earlier for mapping to bring out the corresponding QR code.

8. Open your ODK collect app, tap on the icon on the top right hand corner of the app and select 'Add project'. Proceed to scan the code generated earlier on the FMTM website.

> Note: If you just downloaded the app, click on the **Configure with QR code** option.

Now you can start field mapping!!
