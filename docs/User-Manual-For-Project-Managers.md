## Introduction

A **Mapping Campaign** refers to an organized effort of collecting data
from a particular geographic area/feature and creating maps. This may
involve using various mapping technologies such as; GPS, satellite
imagery, or crowdsourced data. These technologies are used to gather
information about the area of interest.

Mapping campaigns can be carried out for lots of different purposes,
some examples are:

- Disaster Response and Recovery
- Environmental Conservation
- Urban planning or;
- Social and Political Activism.

They often involve collaboration between organizations like; Government
Agencies, Non-profit Groups and volunteers.

Once the data is collected, it is analyzed and processed to create
detailed maps that can have a variety of use cases. These could be:

- Identifying areas of need.
- Planning infrastructure and development projects.
- Understanding the impact of environmental changes on the landscape,
  etc.

## An Overview Of FMTM In Relations With HOT, OSM and ODK

The **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT**) is a non-profit
organization that uses open mapping data to support humanitarian and
disaster response efforts around the world. **The Field Mapping Task
Manager (FMTM)** is one of the tools that **HOT** used to coordinate and
manage mapping projects.

**FMTM** is a software tool that helps project managers to organize and
manage mapping tasks. It assigns those tasks to volunteers and tracks
their progress. The tool includes features for collaborative editing,
data validation, and error detection. This ensures that the data
collected by volunteers is accurate and reliable.

**FMTM** is designed to be used in conjunction with **Open Data Kit
(ODK)**. **ODK** is a free and open-source set of tools that allows
users to create, collect, and manage data with mobile devices. The
**ODK** provides a set of open-source tools that allow users to build
forms, collect data in the field, and aggregate data on a central
server. It is commonly used for data collection in research, monitoring
and evaluation, and other development projects.

Project managers use **FMTM** to manage tasks and assign them to
volunteers. The data collected by the volunteer via ODK is typically
uploaded to **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** where it is used to create more
detailed and accurate maps of the affected area. **OSM** is a free and
open-source map of the world that is created and maintained by
volunteers.

Overall, the **FMTM** tool is an important component of **HOT**'s
efforts to support disaster response and humanitarian efforts around the
world. By coordinating mapping activities and ensuring the accuracy and
reliability of the data collected by volunteers, **FMTM** helps to
provide critical information that can be used to support decision-making
and improve the effectiveness of humanitarian efforts.


## Prerequisites
- Stable Internet connection
- Knowledge on field mapping . If you are new to mapping we suggest you to read [this](https://tasks.hotosm.org/learn/map) .
- Account on ODK Central Server. [Here are the instructions for setting up an ODK Central server on Digital Ocean](https://docs.getodk.org/central-install-digital-ocean/) (it's very similar on AWS or whatever)

3. If a task is already locked by another user, choose a different task that is available for mapping.If a task is already locked by another user, choose a different task that is available for mapping.
  - The drop down icon beside **LEGEND** displays a color code. This
   color code lets you know the status of each task on the map.

     - **READY** means that task is available to be mapped
     - **LOCKED FOR MAPPING** means that task is already being mapped by another volunteer and therefore unavailable for mapping
     - **MAPPED** or **READY FOR VALIDATION** means that task has been completely mapped and ready to be validated.
     - **LOCKED FOR VALIDATION** means that task has been mapped and being validated.
     - **VALIDATED** means that task has successfully been validated and completely mapped with no errors
     - **INVALIDATED** or **MORE MAPPING NEEDED** means that task did not pass the validation process and needs more mapping
     - **BAD** means that task is not clear and cannot be mapped

> Note: 'task' refers to each section of the map enclosed in the dotted
> lines and each task has a corresponding number tag.

  - To begin mapping, click on a task closest to you that has the color
   code associated with **READY** and change it's status from **READY**
   to **LOCKED FOR MAPPING**. Remember to take note of the number tag.
  - Scroll to the bottom of the page. The **ACTIVITIES** tab shows the
   tasks either **LOCKED FOR MAPPING**, **BAD** or **LOCKED FOR
   VALIDATION**. You can search for tasks with the status mentioned
   using the number tag associated with each task.


4. Use the QR code to start mapping the selected task using the ODK Collect app on your mobile phone.
5. Install and open the ODK Collect app on your phone.
6. Set up the project details by scanning the QR code provided.
7. Once the project is set up in the app, start a new form based on the selected form from the project setup.
8. Fill in the questionnaires and collect data for the field mapping exercise.
9. Save and send the completed form to the server.
10. After completing the assigned task, go back to the project platform on FMTM and mark it as fully mapped.
